In this blog post I'm going to highlight some steps that were helpful along the way. <!--more-->

After seeing other people talking about their journey into open source software, I decided to take my chances and created this [PR](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/11583) during past week.

A [friend of mine](https://twitter.com/freethejazz) mentioned this [First Timers Only medium post](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/first-timers-only-78281ea47455) from [Kent C. Dodds](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds). After getting convinced that I was, too, capable of doing some contribution to the open source community, I started searching for other online resources that could help me to get started.
Later on at the same day I found out the [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) website that is an initiative of [Kent](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) and [Scott Hanselman](https://github.com/shanselman). They go straight to the point and list an awesome site that aggregates project that actively want help. It is http://up-for-grabs.net. Once at this website, you can filter projects by popular tags - like main language or platform - and start searching were exactly you would fit easily. As I read before, I tried to pick a project that I'd be comfortable with - and by comfortable I mean that I already have some knowledge of the language and the tooling that it's used. Starting something new has it's challenges already so I wasn't looking to make things even more complicated.
After some browsing, I decided to go with [cdnjs](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs) project. They have a huge number of issues open (by the time that I write this, I can see [almost 800 of them](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues)) and they also already took the initiative of [labeling the issues for beginners](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ABEGINNER) like me. :)
The [issue](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues/11474) that I picked consisted of adding a library to their repo. The cdnjs project has a good [contributing document](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) which was very helpful and really made a difference for me.

After I submitted the [PR](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/11583) I got some requests from the project maintainers to fix stuff that I missed - like *using source code from a development branch instead of a tag or release branch* or *not squashing commits as their contributing documentation suggested*.

That's it.
