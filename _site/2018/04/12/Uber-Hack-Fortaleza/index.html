		<h2>Uber Hack Fortaleza</h2>
		<p>12 Apr 2018</p>
	</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		<p>During the previous weekend I participated in Uber’s hack Fortaleza edition. The hackathon was as a 30hr solution contest and the topic was urban mobility. <!--more-->
I’m going to write about my learning experience during the event. My effort here is to summarize all the learning and not exactly talk about the event in general.</p>

<p>Even though Uber was organizing the event, we were asked to propose solutions regardless of the company product.  We had these criteria to be followed:</p>

<pre><code>1. Creativity
2. Applicability
3. Disruption
4. Viability
5. Prototype quality
</code></pre>

<p>With those criteria in mind, I urged my team to focus on the whole solution instead of just building a software prototype and leaving lose ends, for instance, not being sure about the targeted user group or if the problem we were aiming to solve wasn’t a user pain point.
Our idea was to create a carpooling platform targeting college students. The platform will connect riders and drivers based on the drivers’ daily route to college. The motivation came from ourselves, since most of the team members were or still are college students and suffered daily with the lack of quality from public transport solutions in our city.
To achieve our goal, we decided to start by validating our idea using a google form. We came up with strategic questions that would support - or deny - our assumptions. The questions that gave us sensible knowledge were regarding</p>

<pre><code>1. Motivation
	1. why drivers give rides?
2. Price range
	1. how much riders would be willing to pay?
</code></pre>

<p>For our surprise, <em>around 70% of drivers</em> who already give riders don’t charge anything for the ride - <em>they do it to help others</em>. Also, <em>63% of the riders</em> were willing to <em>pay more than they already</em> pay in the public transportation service given that they will have more comfort. This leaded us to propose a <em>zero cost ride</em> for the driver as a value proposition. The platform will receive the riders’ payment and transfer the value to the driver.
Our value proposition consisted in three things: <em>Zero cost for drivers</em>, <em>Comfort to riders</em>, <em>Online platform to connect users</em>.</p>

<p>Another critical learning regarding the designs of our proposed application.  Due to my lack of design skills, I thought I wouldn’t be able to suggest or contribute to the task. Thankfully, one of the mentors had two critical activities to do with the team: Card Sorting and Crazy Eight!</p>

<p>Card Sorting consists of a 2min task where each team members writes - we did one feature per post-it - down as many features as one can think about regarding the product. After the time is over, as a team, we grouped the post-its and, because of our time restriction, ended up with 8 features to focus on.
Now Crazy eight comes in! Since we decided the 8 most important features of our project, it’s time to sketch them! Everyone on the team had to do a sketch. We used a plain sheet of paper to achieve this. After you fold the sheet three times, you have 8 pieces of paper. And for every feature, we had a minute to draw it on the paper.
After everyone finished the drawing, each one of us had to explain how the drawings related to each other and how the user would interact with the app.
In a 30hr sprint, so much information gets lost because of mis communication that this task had an incredible impact for our team. We were finally talking about the same thing after it and were finally able to start a divide and conquer strategy.</p>

<p>Another key activity was the presentation checkpoint. We had 10 minutes to present all the progress we had made up to that point. Honestly, we were quite lost when we reached the room. Even thought we had already all the design exercise, the learning outcome due to the market research that I described early, wasn’t in place yet. The necessity to present something that is not fully designed is at the same time embarrassing, but helpful because it helped us to realize what was still open ended and had to be improved.</p>

<p>After submitting the code solution because the hack was coming to the end, I had to start working on the presentation as I would be the pitcher. The thing that helped me the most was to start by searching for online presentation templates. In this way, instead of creating my own presentation structure, I’d have to focus on the content only.
And the thing that made me suffered the most, by far, was pitching. Oh man, it was hard to summarize our idea in some sentences. Also, it was my first time pitching. I had three minutes to present and the jury would have two more minutes to ask questions. More specifically, somehow I had the feeling that my team could win the competition. This line of thinking made me fell so much pressure that was hard to came up with ideas and confidence. After some practice, I was able to create a sort of script that would guide my presentation and some sentences that would create impact among the jury. When I started presenting though, my hand was shaking so hard lol that it was noticed by everyone in the room. Some people even asked me about it later. Probably, this is the most important thing that I need to work on next: <em>public speaking.</em></p>

<p>We didn’t win the event. A friend of mine that had presented right before me, killed in her presentation. Which btw made it even harder to present when I got there lol. But yeah, lessons learned. :)</p>
