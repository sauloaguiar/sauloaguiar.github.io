	<h3>Reading List</h3>
		<span>
		Since last year, I've been focusing on reading books and I'll be listing them here to keep myself motivated.
		The goal is two read at least a book per month, but I've been pushing myself to read a book every two weeks.
		I tend to read non technical stuff and I'm open for recomendations.
