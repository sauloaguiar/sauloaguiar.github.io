In this first blog post I'm going to help you setup Jekyll in a Koding.com account.<!--more-->

To start this, make sure you already have your koding.com access. If you have some familiarity within linux terminal usage, it will be helpful too.

### Installing Prerequisites

Install ruby, ruby development libraries and the make helper.

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev make gcc node-js
{% endhighlight %}
