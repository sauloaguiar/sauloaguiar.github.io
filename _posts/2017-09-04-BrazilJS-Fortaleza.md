Hi there, this time I'll be sharing with you my experience in BrazilJS conference (Fortaleza edition). <!--more-->

The conference happened in two days, September 1st and 2nd, and it had a lot of great speakers with very interesting topics. As I'm moving towards a javascript oriented work, developing react and dealing with other front end challenges, I was very happy to participate in it. The thing is, I ended up volunteering to be an interpreter during the 2nd day, since the organizers had some issues with the hired personnel in the first day.

It all happened after some friends of mine [@rafaelsales](https://twitter.com/rafaelsales), [@cmilfont](https://twitter.com/cmilfont) put me in touch with the organization [@jaydson](https://twitter.com/jaydson) that welcomed me very nicely. I was actually a backup for the 2nd day and ended up translating the very last english talk from the day that was done by [@salvadelapuente](https://twitter.com/salvadelapuente) where he explained and showcased how [a-frame](https://aframe.io/) makes VR easy on the web using a declarative style of programming.

Some other talks that I really liked were given by [@jemyoung](https://twitter.com/JemYoung) and [@luiguid](https://twitter.com/luiguild). Jem mentioned some simple but very useful steps that everyone could take in a daily basis that would have a huge impact on the codebase and will impact in the team overall performance. Luigui's talk completely blew my mind by exploring how maps and data can be used in web apps using [esri arcgis](http://www.esri.com/arcgis/about-arcgis) to aggregate value to a business. The perspective of creating a visualization that provides value to the business really caught my attention.

Last but not least, an incredible thing happened in the conference. [@jelielmendes](https://twitter.com/jelielmendes) asked all the women at the auditorium to join her at the stage to [represent women in tech.](https://twitter.com/yuriploc/status/903973036403122176) Isn't this amazing? I also had the opportunity to see other women talking. [@kosamari](https://twitter.com/kosamari) did a presentation on how to be a compiler and [@Feh_Bernardo](https://twitter.com/Feh_Bernardo) did an overview on new stuff that is available in ES6,7 and 8!
Moreover, taking advantage of this topic, here is a small list of women that I started following on twitter. Yes, a bunch of very smart and talented female engineers that helped me to overcome coding challenges.

I hope this blog post has helped you to realize how nice is to go to conferences, show respect to women that do incredible work as well, [do networking](https://twitter.com/franzejr/status/904053229029380096) and, maybe even volunteer to help with something :)
